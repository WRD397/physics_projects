### Singularity Removal

There has been an enigma regarding the singularity in the interior of a
Black Hole since ages. This physical impossibility is assumed to be hidden
by the existence of the so called Event Horizon of the Black Hole. The
singularity gives birth to an extremely high curvature onto the space-time,
near the Planck scale. In such a high curvature, it is known that General
Relativity breaks down. This failure leads the physicists to think that this
singularity might be somehow tamed by higher order corrections to General
Relativity or Quantum Gravitational effects. Now, there is a possible way
to escape this impossibility at the center of a Black Hole by utilizing the
solution to the Einstein equation provided by the well known physicist de
Sitter in 1917.


### Bardeen Black Hole

The Reissner-Nordstrom solution of the Einstein equation denotes a
black hole shielding a singularity. In nature, the black hole is formed as an
end state of the collapse of a star of a particular mass range. But, it is widely
believed that these singularities do not exist in nature, but that they are the
creation of General Relativity. The existence of a singularity means at that
very point spacetime fails to exist, signaling a breakdown of laws of physics.
So, it has become extremely necessary to substitute the singularity by any
other object in any other more suitable theory.
The earliest idea in mid 1960’s, due to Sakharov and Gliner suggests
that the singularity could be avoided by matter specifically with a de Sitter
core, with the equation of state p = −ρ . This equation of state is obeyed
by cosmological vacuum and hence, the energy-stress tensor Tµν takes on a
false vacuum of the form Tµν = Λgµν , where Λ is the cosmological constant.
Thus spacetime filled with a vacuum could provide a proper discrimi-
nation at the final stage of the gravitational collapse, replacing the future
singularity. The first regular black hole solution based on this idea was
proposed by Bardeen, according to whom there are horizons but no singu-
larity.
